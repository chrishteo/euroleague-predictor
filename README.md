# EuroLeague Predictor

A Monte Carlo simulation-based prediction system for the EuroLeague basketball season. Predict final standings, playoff probabilities, and track team performance throughout the season.

## 📋 Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **React App** (`euroleague-predictor.jsx`) - Interactive web interface for viewing standings, adding results, and running predictions
2. **Python Data Fetcher** (`euroleague_fetcher.py`) - Script to fetch live data from the official EuroLeague API

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the React App Directly

The React app comes pre-loaded with current 2025-26 season standings. You can:
- View current standings
- Add new match results manually
- Run Monte Carlo simulations to predict final standings

Simply open `euroleague-predictor.jsx` in any React environment (Claude Artifacts, CodeSandbox, local React project, etc.)

### Option 2: Fetch Live Data with Python

For the most up-to-date data:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install euroleague-api pandas

# Run the fetcher
python euroleague_fetcher.py
```

This will create a `euroleague_data/` folder with fresh data files.

## 🏀 React App Features

### Standings Tab
- Current league standings with all 20 teams
- Win/Loss record, points for/against, point differential
- Color-coded playoff zones:
  - 🟢 Green: Direct Playoffs (positions 1-6)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Play-In Tournament (positions 7-10)
  - ⚪ White: Eliminated (positions 11-20)

### Predictions Tab
- Monte Carlo simulation engine (5,000 iterations)
- ELO-style team ratings based on:
  - Win percentage
  - Point differential
  - Home court advantage
- Output includes:
  - Predicted average finishing position
  - Playoff qualification probability
  - Play-In probability
  - Elimination probability

### Matches Tab
- View all recorded match results
- Add new results via modal form
- Delete incorrectly entered matches
- Data persists across sessions (browser storage)

## 🐍 Python Fetcher Features

The `euroleague_fetcher.py` script connects to the official EuroLeague API and retrieves:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Standings | Current league table with W-L records |
| Game Results | All played games with scores |
| Player Stats | Individual player performance metrics |
| Team Stats | Team-level aggregate statistics |

### Configuration

Edit these variables at the top of the script:

```python
SEASON = 2025          # Season start year (2025 = 2025-26 season)
COMPETITION = "E"      # E = EuroLeague, U = EuroCup
OUTPUT_DIR = "euroleague_data"
```

### Output Formats

The script generates data in multiple formats:
- **JSON files** - For programmatic use
- **JavaScript module** - Ready to import into React apps

## 📊 Prediction Methodology

### Team Rating Calculation

Each team receives an ELO-style rating:

```
Rating = 1500 + (WinPct - 0.5) × 400 + AvgMargin × 10
```

Where:
- `WinPct` = Wins / Games Played
- `AvgMargin` = (Points For - Points Against) / Games Played

### Win Probability

For each simulated game:

```
P(Win) = 1 / (1 + 10^((OpponentRating - TeamRating - HomeAdvantage) / 400))
```

Home advantage is set to +50 rating points (~3-4 point spread).

### Simulation Process

1. Calculate current ratings for all teams
2. For each of 5,000 simulations:
   - Simulate remaining games for each team
   - Randomly assign opponents (simplified scheduling)
   - Determine winner based on win probability
   - Record final standings
3. Aggregate results to calculate position probabilities

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjusting Simulation Parameters

In `euroleague-predictor.jsx`:

```javascript
const TOTAL_GAMES = 38;      // Games per team in regular season
const SIMULATIONS = 5000;    // Number of Monte Carlo iterations
```

### Adding Historical Data

To pre-load historical game data, modify the `initialTeams` array with updated statistics.

## 📱 Deployment Options

### Claude Artifacts
Copy the JSX code directly into a Claude artifact for instant preview.

### Local Development
```bash
npx create-react-app euroleague-app
# Copy euroleague-predictor.jsx content to src/App.js
npm start
```

### CodeSandbox / StackBlitz
Create a new React project and paste the code.

## 🌐 Data Sources

- **Official API**: `api-live.euroleague.net` (used by Python fetcher)
- **Python Package**: [euroleague-api](https://pypi.org/project/euroleague-api/) by giasemidis
- **Manual Entry**: Add results directly in the React app

## ⚠️ Limitations

1. **CORS Restrictions**: The EuroLeague API cannot be called directly from browsers due to CORS policies. Use the Python script for data fetching.

2. **Simplified Scheduling**: The simulation uses random opponent assignment rather than the actual remaining schedule.

3. **No Player-Level Modeling**: Current predictions are team-based only. Player injuries, transfers, and individual performance are not factored in.

4. **Head-to-Head Tiebreakers**: The app uses point differential as the tiebreaker, not the official EuroLeague head-to-head rules.

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Future Improvements

- [ ] Import actual remaining schedule for more accurate simulations
- [ ] Add head-to-head record tracking
- [ ] Include recent form (last 5/10 games) in ratings
- [ ] Player-level impact modeling
- [ ] Historical season comparisons
- [ ] Export predictions to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Auto-sync with API via backend proxy
